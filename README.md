# AppBoilerplate
A boilerplate that helps you set the environment or test things quickly without the need to set up an environment.

The boilerplate creates bundles for js and css files and it load them into the app.

When `gulp` is running if you make a change to the code js, css or html the browser will sync those changes.

Personally I use this boilerplate to test markup or do quick tests, essentially it coulds like jsfiddle but locally.

# How to use
In order to run the boilerplate you need to :

* Run `npm install`
* Run `gulp`

If you don't have gulp installed globally you need to :

* Run `npm install gulp -g`
